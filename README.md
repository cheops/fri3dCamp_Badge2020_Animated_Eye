2. Search for TFT_eSPI and click on install
3. (optional) Search for SparkFun_LIS2DH12_Arduino_Library and click on install

### Configure TFT_eSPI
copy User_setup.h to TFT_eSPI in your Arduino libraries folder  
  you can find the Arduino libraries folder like this:
  In the Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences > Sketchbook location:
  go to this folder/libraries/TFT_eSPI and overwrite User_setup.h with the file from this repository

### Select the correct board
1. Open the file Animated_Eyes_1/Animated_Eyes_1.ino from this repository in the arduino IDE
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board > ESP32 Wrover Module
3. In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Port > Select the port that the badge is connected on

### Compile and Upload
1. Press the Upload button, or go to Sketch > Upload


## Additional info
The display switch should be in the ON position (down)
If you want to enable the display backlight also when in the AUTO position then uncomment line 89
```
#define BACKLIGHT_CONNECTED_TO_LIS
```
This will configure the interrupt pin of the LIS accelerometer to be always on

## Manual blink the eye
Press the Boot button on the back to manually blink the eye
